# Code done for ILVTE Summer 2017

RF-IR Remote: Software and schematic for RF-IR Remote. Remote received an RF transmitter signal and output an IR signal following the NEC1 protocol to an HDMI switcher.

Scripts: Software for camera scripts, mainly refactored code, as this was my first time doing any larger-scale programming.
